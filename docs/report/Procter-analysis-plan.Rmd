# Planned revisions to reproduction of ....

Author: Will Procter

## Analysis

Enumerate and justify changes to analytical plan here
First, I plan to revise the discussion at the end of the study into a cogent conclusion section that synthesizes my thoughts with those of prior authors.

Second, I plan to fix the format on the "missing data" section table format so that the table does not run off the side of the page.

Third, I plan to fix the color ramp of the last map so that it covers the full range of oranges --> **Map each country's weight in GEE model**

Fourth, I will overall break the more complex sections into intermediary steps in the name of clarity

## Results

3) I changed the midpoint value for the map from 0 to 0.5 --> adds more contrast and extends the orange color ramp

## Discussion

Describe how you will interpret the results of your changes here.
For example, in hypothetical terms, if my new/revised map shows ---, it will mean that ---.
