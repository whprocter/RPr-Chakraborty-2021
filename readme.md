# Reproduction of Chakraborty 2021 analysis of unequal distribution of COVID-19 for people with disabilities

This study is a replication of:

>  Chakraborty, J. 2021. Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S. *Disability and Health Journal* **14**:1-5. DOI:[10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007)

## Abstract

> The original paper is a national scale study of the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and disability characteristics (by demographic) in the United States. The paper aims to determine whether COVID-19 incidence is more significant in counties with larger proportions of socio-demographically disadvantaged people with disabilities, based on race, ethnicity, poverty status, and biological sex.
